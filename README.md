#Sending Emails with Python

With this small python script you can send emails, e.g. with your gmail account#

Make sure to change the settings in config.py
- mailToAdress: Enter the target email address
- mailFromServer: Enter the mailserver, e.g. "smtp.gmail.com:587" for gmail
- mailFromAdress: Enter your email
- mailFromPassword: Enter your password

In case you use gmail, make sure to allow usage of "Less Secure Apps", otherwise the python script will be identified as insecure and blocked by gmail
You can allow "Less Secure Apps" here: http://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
